The sqlog package contains a set of scripts useful for creating, 
populating, and issuing queries to a SLURM job log database. 

COMPONENTS

 sqlog          The "SLURM Query Log" utility. Provides a single interface to
                query jobs from the SLURM job log database and/or current 
                queue of running jobs.

 slurm-joblog   Logs completed jobs using SLURM's jobcomp/script interface
                to the SLURM job log database and an optional text file.

 
 sqlog-db-util  Administrative utility used to create SLURM job log database
                and its corresponding users. Also provides an interface to
                "backfill" the database using existing SLURM joblog files
                created by the jobcomp/filetxt plugin.

 sqlog.conf     World-readable config file. Contains local configuration for
                SQL host, read-only user, and read-only password.
 
 slurm-joblog.conf
                Private configuration for slurm-joblog script (also used by 
                by sqlog-db-util). Contains SQL read-write user and password,
                root user passwd (for sqlog-db-util) and a list of hosts
		that should have RW access to DB.
         
 
CONFIGURATION

For fully-automated operation, both the /etc/slurm/sqlog.conf and
/etc/slurm/slurm-joblog.conf must exist. These files are read 
using perl's do() function, so the files can and must be valid perl.
This allows a bit of scripting to get the values if necessary.
(See the sqlog doc directory for examples).

The available variables in each config file include:

 sqlog.conf:

 SQLHOST          SQL server hostname (default = sqlhost)
 SQLUSER          Read-only user      (default = slurm_read)
 SQLPASS          Read-only password  (default = none)
 SQLDB            DB name             (default = slurm)

 slurm-joblog.conf:

 SQLUSER          Read-write user     (default = slurm)
 SQLPASS          Read-write password (not set)
 SQLROOTPASS      DB root password    (not set)
 @SQLRWHOSTS      Read-write hosts    (array of hosts to give rw access)
 JOBLOGFILE       txt joblog location (set if you want to log to a file too)


CREATING JOB LOG DATABASE

Once the config files exist, the following command will create the 
SLURM job log database:
 
 sqlog-db-util --create

If you have existing text joblog files you'd like to seed the new
DB with, use 

 sqlog-db-util --backfill [FILE]...

e.g.

 sqlog-db-util --backfill /var/log/slurm/joblog*

ENABLE JOB LOGGING

To enable the SLURM job log database, the following configuration
options must be set in slurm.conf:

 JobCompType = jobcomp/script
 JobCompLoc = /usr/libexec/sqlog/slurm-joblog

Adjust the path if the sqlog RPM was installed with a different PREFIX.
This has only been tested on SLURM 1.2.10 or greater.

Restart slurmctld and slurm-joblog will begin logging jobs as they
complete.
