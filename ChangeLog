	* sqlog : Changed range operator to ".."
	  --time may specify a min, max, or window of time.
	  @ may be used to escape leading + or - in datetime values.

	* sqlog : Added RANGE operator description to usage, 
	  --time still needs support.

	* sqlog : Added support for 'S' in time duration, only 's' was working.

	* sqlog : Changed comparison for runtime, minruntime, and maxruntime
	 to string equality tests of "eq" and "ne" since numeric operators of ">"
	 would get confused for input such as -T +1h.

	* sqlog : Changed 'N-M' to 'N--M' to be consistent with time window format.
	 This way there is one consistent set of operators +/-/--.

	* sqlog : New options --start, --start-before, --start-after,
	 --end, --end-before, --end-after. Removed --before and --after
	 which are replaced by --start-before, --start-after.

	* sqlog : Query running jobs by default and add -X, --no-running.

	* sqlog : Add functions for parsing time ranges and min/max specifications.

	* sqlog : Fix time window parsing.

	* sqlog.1 : Added man page.
