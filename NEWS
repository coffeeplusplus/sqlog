Version 0.13 (2009-04-01):
 - Update database schema from v1 to v2.
 - Added --covert, --backup, --prune, --obfuscate options to
   sqlog-db-util, as well as, --cores-per-node, --notrack,
   and --delay-index.  Added "CONVERTING" and "BACKING UP"
   sections to README to discuss new options.
 - Added new indicies to schema: increased from just: username
   to: username, jobname, starttime, endtime, runtime, nodecount,
   corecount, nodename.  Speeds up common queries.
 - Add corecount column to track number of cores allocated to each
   job, which is useful for machines using the consumable resources
   SLURM plugin.
 - Added --ncores, --mincores, --maxcores options to sqlog to
   specify conditions on new corecount column.
 - Extend nodelist column to fix truncation when very fragmented
   nodelists exceeded the 1024 char limit initially set for the field.

Version 0.12 (2008-12-03):
 - Do not use Date::Manip routines to convert dates to "Unix time"
   (seconds since epoch) Date::Manip doesn't handle daylight savings 
   transitions properly and instead uses the current DST offset.
 - New --regex option allows sqlog to query with regexes for jobids,
   user names, states, paritions, and job names, instead of a simple
   exact match.

Version 0.11 (2008-06-24):
 - New slurm-joblog.conf parameter $SQLNETWORK sets the network
   on which read access to database is allowed. Default = 192.168.%.%.
 - sqlog-db-util now deletes slurm* users from mysql DB before 
   creating new user entries to avoid stale privileges.

Version 0.10 (2008-04-18):
 - Add OUTPUT FORMAT section to sqlog(1) manpage.
 - Improve RUNTIME parsing in sqlog script.

  -- Allow perl library path and PATH to be specified at RPM build time.
  -- Use __perl RPM macro instead of hardcoding /usr/bin/perl.
  -- Other specfile improvements.
 - Fix sqlog-db-util.8 manpage permissions.

Version 0.6 (2007-08-10):
 - Fix for bug in --end-before and --end-after argument processing.
 - Add new format keys: runtime_s (runtime in seconds) and unixstart/
   unixend (start and end times in seconds since the epoch).

Version 0.5 (2007-08-10):
 - Allow perl path (default = /usr/bin/perl) and
   confdir (default = /etc/slurm) to be overridden at RPM 
   build time via _slurm_confidir and _perl_path.

Version 0.4 (2007-08-07):
 - Fix for broken processing of -s, --states.
 - Sort keys are now applied in "ORDER BY" statement of database query.
 - New format keys "longstart" and "longend" for including year in output.
 - longstart/end are displayed by default in "long" and "freeform" output types.
 - Add support for user configuration in ~/.sqlog. 
 - When sorting start and end time, assume "NONE" is the max date & time.
 - Add string [More results available...] if more results may be in database.
 - Added manpage for sqlog-db-util(8).
 - Manpage and --usage output cleanup.
